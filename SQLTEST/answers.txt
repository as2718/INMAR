3. What was the createDateTime for each redemptionCount in questions 1 and 2?

4. Is there another method you can use to pull back the most recent redemption count, by
 redemption date, for the date range 2023-10-30 to 2023-11-05, for retailer "ABC Store"?
In words, describe how you would do this (no need to write a query, unless youâ€™d like to).

We can achieve same result by using coorelated sub query in place of row_number analytic function.
As we can see below query when we are trying to capture maximum createDateTime we can use correlated sub query 
by passing the values from outer table tblRedemptions-ByDay into the same inner table and get the required createDateTime which will make query to return latest redemptionCount
on the basis of the maximum redemptionDate.

SELECT
  ALL_DATES.ALL_DATE AS redemptionDate,
  COALESCE(MAIN_DATA.redemptionCount, 0) AS redemptionCount
FROM 
  (SELECT ALL_DATE FROM UNNEST(GENERATE_DATE_ARRAY('2023-10-30', '2023-11-05')) AS ALL_DATE) AS ALL_DATES
LEFT OUTER JOIN 
  (
    SELECT 
      redemption_data.redemptionDate,
      redemption_data.redemptionCount
    FROM 
      `optimal-tea-329509.reporting.tblRedemptions-ByDay` AS redemption_data
    JOIN 
      `optimal-tea-329509.reporting.tblRetailers` AS retailer
    ON 
      retailer.id = redemption_data.retailerId
    WHERE 
      retailer.retailerName = 'ABC Store'
      AND redemption_data.redemptionDate BETWEEN '2023-10-30' AND '2023-11-05'
      AND redemption_data.createDateTime = (
        SELECT MAX(createDateTime)
        FROM `optimal-tea-329509.reporting.tblRedemptions-ByDay`
        WHERE redemptionDate = redemption_data.redemptionDate
        AND retailerId=redemption_data.retailerId
      )
  ) AS MAIN_DATA
ON    
  ALL_DATES.ALL_DATE = MAIN_DATA.redemptionDate;
